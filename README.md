DIY-Gameboy Project

Overview 

A handheld gaming device made using a simple circuit and an Arduino Uno. This project uses an ethernet shield's micro sd slot to
read integer values to be used to access different control structures (if statements) that contain hardcoded games. This gives the 
illusion that the gameboy is reading the games completely from the SD card like a game cartridge despite the reality that the games
are hardcoded into the sketch and just inaccesible until it's cartridge is accessed. The games on the gameboy will be played with
a potentiometer and push button switch as input and an lcd module as output.
